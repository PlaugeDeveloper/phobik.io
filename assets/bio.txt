Born in Chicago, December 1969, grew up in Thessalonikki, Macedonia, 
Greece for 7 years til 1976, returned to the states & been here 
ever since then.

I started djing in 1979 @ the age of 9 yrs old with my cousin John 
(R.I.P.), in Manhattan, New York City. He was a bartender / busboy, 
working for Studio 54 discotheque / nightclub. One night @ 54, no one 
was able to spin & my cousin asked if I could play tunes for a while. 
They said yes. I was extremely nervous, but once I got started playing 
tunes, everything went well. Helped out there with the resident DJ's: 
Richie Kaczor & Nicky Siano til 1982, when my cousin passed away. 
From there on, I decided to continue as a DJ & make my cousin proud.

I spun at the following venues / discotheques / nightclubs / bars: 
Studio 54 (Manhattan - The Original), Rock-A-Bee's, Gazander's,
Centrum Hall, A. C. Club, La Village Cafe, T.K.O.'s, Cairo's / 
My Sister's House / Club 720, Cafe Kallisto, Merecedez, Crobar, 
Marianna's & Excaliber. Also spun at various venues for rave / 
underground parties between 1991 through 2002. Stopped spinning at
those parties in early 2002, after the drugs were becoming the focus, 
instead of the music & I let them go entirely. It's 2018 now.

Recently, I have my own podcast-based show called Altered Nation. 
I spin Drum & Bass / jungle music mostly these days. I also spin disco, 
house music (all styles) as well as: boogie funk (post disco), 
early electro / hi-NRG / italo disco / alternative / industrial / 
freestyle / 80's & 90's classics, rock, etc.
